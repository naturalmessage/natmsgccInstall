This program is an installer that runs with Python 3 to install the Natural 
Message Command-line Client (natmsgcc).

This is being tested for Windows and UNIX-like operating systems other that Mac
OS X.  There is a GUI application for Mac OS X that will be available for use
soon.

The server verification process is not currently working on Windows due to
compiling problems.  If you have tips on how to comple the C programs in
https://github.com/naturalmessage/natmsgv, contact me a
naturalmessage@fastmail.nl or use the Natural Message client and my contact ID
that comes with the installation.  If there is a compile problem on your OS,
server verification won't work either.  The server verification process is
currently not implemented, but will be implemented soon.

Installation of this program and the Natural Message Command-line Client:

 1) Download the python program using one of these methods:
    A) use a web browser to go to:

      https://github.com/naturalmessage/natmsgccInstall

      and either download the zip file or click NatMsgInstall.py and then
      on the next page click 'raw' and download the python code directly.

		B) from the command line:

    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/naturalmessage/natmsgccInstall/master/NatMsgInstall.py

    curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/naturalmessage/natmsgccInstall/master/NatMsgInstall.py

 2) Install Python 3x if you don't already have it.  If you are using Windows,
    you have to install Python 3.4 or a lower version of 3.4 or else you will
    have to find your own compiled binaries for pycrypto.
    For Windows, be sure to add Python to the search path.

 3) Run the NatMsgInstall.py program using Python 3 with root privileges. 
      For Windows, open a command prompt, use the 'cd' command to navigate to 
      where you downloaded the NatMsgInstall.py file, and run:

        python NatMsgInstall.py
     
      For UNIX-like OS, run:
        sudo python3 NatMsgInstall.py

      or on some systems it might be something like:

        sudo /usr/local/bin/python3 NatMsgInstall.py

  4) This is not fully tested yet, but even after it is tested it will work
     only if the script can determine your package manager (yum, apt-get,
     pkg, etc.) and if it knows the exact name of packages on your system
     (including packages for Python setuptools, gcc, and maybe a couple others).

  5) It might be nice to install an unrtf program if you can (a program that
     remove RTF code so that RTF documents can be displayed as plain text.
